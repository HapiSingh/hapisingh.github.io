# Thoughts

This page is for more personal writing.
Not reviews, not records — just thoughts that don’t fit neatly anywhere else.

Sometimes this will be about games as a medium.
Sometimes it will be about burnout, joy, balance, or how games fit into my life.
Sometimes it might not even be about games at all.

There’s no structure here, and no expectation to post regularly.
If something feels worth putting into words, it goes here.

I've spent several hours trying to make this website, and I'm so confused, it's still so far from where I want it to be, but we're getting there slowly and surely. I'm getting very tired tho lol

I have so much made, and so much written, so having it all backlogged in some permanent way would be really cool, I hope this method is permanent, also this gave me insight into making a website, man I know so little, I'm shocked at how complicated this all is, I still haven't messed with design layouts, or anything, it's all still blank white layouts and stuff

maybe we'll get to where we want to be soon
