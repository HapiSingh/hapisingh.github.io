# Thoughts

This page is for more personal writing.
Not reviews, not records — just thoughts that don’t fit neatly anywhere else.

Sometimes this will be about games as a medium.
Sometimes it will be about burnout, joy, balance, or how games fit into my life.
Sometimes it might not even be about games at all.

There’s no structure here, and no expectation to post regularly.
If something feels worth putting into words, it goes here.
