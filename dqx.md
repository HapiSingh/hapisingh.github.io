# Dragon Quest X

Dragon Quest X has been a meaningful part of my life for a long time.
This page isn’t a guide or a resource — it’s a personal record of my experiences in the game.

I’ll write here about boss fights, memorable moments, people I’ve met, and reflections on how my relationship with the game has changed over time.

Sometimes that means celebrating clears and achievements.
Sometimes it means being honest about burnout, balance, or stepping away for a while.

This space exists to tell *my* story with DQX, not to explain how the game works.
