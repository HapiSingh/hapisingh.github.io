*Games, thoughts, and adventures*
---

Hi, I’m Hapi.

This is a personal space where I write about the games I’ve played, and the ones that stuck with me long after the credits rolled.

I mostly play RPGs, action games, and older titles, and I like writing about *how* games feel — not just whether they’re “good” or “bad.”

I also play **Dragon Quest X**, and I’ll occasionally write about my adventures, boss fights, and reflections from that world as well.

I write when I feel like it.
