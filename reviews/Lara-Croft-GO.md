        Lara Croft GO is actually a really solid puzzle game. I’ve never played a Tomb Raider game before,
        and from what I understand this isn’t representative of the main series anyway, so I’m judging it
        purely as a puzzle experience.

        For under $2, I had a genuinely good time. The puzzles are fun, the set pieces are interesting,
        and it’s short, sweet, and easy to play casually without much mental overhead.

        The biggest problem, though, is the controls. They’re atrocious on PC. The game is clearly designed
        for mobile and barely adapted at all — you still “swipe” to move, which leads to constant misinputs.
        Using a controller doesn’t really fix this either and still feels awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, it’s fine. I wouldn’t recommend it as anything special, but if you go in with the right
        expectations, it’s a short, enjoyable puzzle game that does its job. And honestly? Still better
        than Mega Man 7.
