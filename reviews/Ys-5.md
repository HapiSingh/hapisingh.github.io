Action RPG · PlayStation 2

Ys V is a game that left me genuinely disappointed, not because it is outright terrible, but because it so clearly could have been great.

My first few hours with Kefin were surprisingly strong. The game immediately has a charming visual style, with cute sprite work and a warm, colorful aesthetic that stood out to me. Movement and basic combat feel fine, and the magic system is a neat addition, even if I personally did not rely on it much. The soundtrack is also excellent overall. While it has more misses than I am used to from the series, there are still plenty of tracks that I really enjoyed.

Unfortunately, once you get past roughly the first third of the game, the cracks become impossible to ignore.

The biggest issue by far is dungeon and area design. Layouts are confusing, repetitive, and poorly communicated to the player. Rooms often look nearly identical, with very little in the way of landmarks or visual cues to help you understand where you are or where you have been. There is no dungeon map system to provide clarity, which turns exploration into a frustrating guessing game rather than something engaging.

Backtracking is frequent, dead ends are common, and the overall layouts feel inconvenient rather than thoughtfully challenging. Because so many rooms share the same appearance, it is extremely easy to get lost with no reliable way to reorient yourself. Even when using external map guides, following them can still be difficult due to how visually indistinct the environments are.

Exploration also feels unrewarding. There are very few treasure chests or meaningful discoveries tucked away in these confusing layouts, making it hard to feel motivated to explore beyond simply trying to find the correct path forward. To make matters worse, several dungeons reuse the same assets and visual themes, making them difficult to tell apart and draining any sense of identity they might have had. Even the dungeons that do look different rarely feel memorable, and sometimes the music does little to help elevate them.

Boss encounters are inconsistent as well. Some are fine, but many feel awkward or underwhelming, adding to the sense that the game never quite comes together in a satisfying way.

As for the story, Ys narratives have never been the main draw for me, and Kefin did not change that. Nothing stood out as particularly bad, but it also failed to leave much of an impression. I never felt especially invested, and much of it went over my head without hurting or helping the experience either way.

In the end, Ys V is an average game at best. It feels held back by budget limitations and unfinished design decisions, especially when it comes to dungeon layout, readability, and variety. With proper maps, clearer landmarks, less recycled content, and more consistent bosses, this could have been a game I genuinely loved. As it stands, it is a rough and frustrating experience that squanders its early promise.
