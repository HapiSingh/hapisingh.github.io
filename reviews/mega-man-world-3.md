        Mega Man World 3 ended up being a pretty solid, very average Mega Man game for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically, it impressed me more than the first two World games. It feels more polished
        and confident in how it adapts the Classic Mega Man formula to the Game Boy. But at the
        same time, it’s also exactly more of the same. If you liked the first two, you’ll like
        this one too. It’s fun, familiar, and easy to play in short bursts.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, I wouldn’t really recommend it as anything special. It doesn’t stand out,
        shake things up, or leave much of a lasting impression. But if you’re running low on
        Classic Mega Man and just want another entry to casually enjoy, this fits that role
        perfectly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Short, solid, enjoyable, and still better than Mega Man 7.
