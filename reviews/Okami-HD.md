    Ōkami HD is a game I find myself deeply respecting, admiring, and appreciating far more than I consistently enjoyed playing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I highly recommend it, but I also highly recommend it specifically to people who do not mind very slow pacing at times. It is a one-of-a-kind experience, and that alone earns it a thumbs up from me.
  </p>

    Visually, it is absolutely incredible. The art style and presentation still look better than many modern games, and it genuinely feels timeless. While the game leans more desaturated than my personal taste, that is ultimately a preference issue rather than a flaw. The amount of effort, care, and intent poured into the visual identity is unmistakable. Even as someone who is not especially drawn to traditional Japanese art, I can still clearly recognize how thoughtful and admirable the execution is. It is a beautiful game in a way that feels sincere rather than flashy.

    Movement is one of Ōkami’s strongest elements. Controlling Amaterasu feels wonderful, and simply running around the overworld is extremely satisfying. The speed, fluidity, and responsiveness make traversal a joy, and the animations elevate this even further. Watching Amaterasu run, stop, fight, and interact with the world is endlessly charming. Nearly every character animation feels full of personality and care, and this is one of the areas where the game truly shines.

    The music, while I think it could have used a bit more variety or stronger vibes at times, fits the atmosphere very well. It complements the world and tone without ever feeling out of place, and overall it adds to the experience rather than detracting from it. Combined with the visuals, the game succeeds strongly at building a cohesive and memorable atmosphere.
  </p>

    Combat is solid, if somewhat simple. It feels a bit below the standard set by later PlatinumGames titles, but it is still enjoyable and functional. The variety of weapons helps keep combat interesting, and I personally gravitated toward the beads, which I enjoyed using as a whip. While the system does not evolve dramatically over time, it remains competent and satisfying enough to support the game.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story is also quite good. It takes its time building up themes and hinting at future developments, and I think the payoff at the end is genuinely effective. There is clear intent behind the narrative, and when it comes together, it works.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, pacing is where Ōkami consistently struggles, and it is the game’s biggest weakness. The game feels padded and stretched far beyond what it needed to be. I frequently found myself putting it down, not because I disliked it, but because I was tired. Dialogue scenes often go on too long, cutscenes frequently stack back to back, and there are large stretches where very little meaningful gameplay happens. These constant interruptions severely damage the game’s momentum.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dungeon design is uneven as well. Some dungeons feel too short, some too long, some not integrated enough into the world, and one in particular felt so over-incorporated that it completely killed my interest. None of them are outright bad, but the inconsistency adds to the sense that the game is poorly paced and overly drawn out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Battle encounters further contribute to this problem. Instead of fighting seamlessly in the overworld, enemies pull you into separate battle arenas. After combat, you are scored, and the delay before regaining control feels noticeably long. This constant stopping and starting disrupts the game’s flow and clashes heavily with how good movement and exploration feel when you are actually allowed to play.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Celestial Brush is a great idea conceptually and thematically, but its execution in this version does not fully land for me. On the Wii, where you could point directly at the screen, it felt much more natural and engaging. Using a controller stick to draw instead feels clunky and acts as another pace breaker. While the mechanic remains creative and visually fitting, its frequent use further slows the game down, especially as its novelty fades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, Ōkami has a unique identity unlike almost any other game. It is artistically stunning, full of heart, and clearly made with passion. The gameplay is solid, the world is memorable, and the story has meaningful payoff. However, it feels stretched, padded, and overlong. What could have been a tight and impactful 20-hour experience ends up dragging itself out far longer than it needs to.
