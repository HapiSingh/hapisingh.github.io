Awaria is the kind of game that reminds me why being a PC gamer is worth it.

It is a completely free, zero dollar game, yet it delivers strong level design, great music, well paced difficulty, and a silly but charming story that helps balance out the darker tone of its setting. It never feels cheap or throwaway. There is clear care and intention behind every part of it.

This is a hard game, and most levels will take multiple attempts. But deaths are instant and restarts are immediate, which keeps frustration extremely low. Failing never feels punishing, it feels encouraging. You always want to try again.

Because of that, Awaria stays fun even at its toughest. Every clear feels earned, and the challenge consistently feels fair.

I highly recommend this to everyone. It is free, so you have nothing to lose, and it is a genuinely great time. Even if it does not fully click with you, it is absolutely worth trying.
