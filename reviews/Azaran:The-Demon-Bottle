# Azaran: The Demon Bottle

Puzzle Adventure · PC

Azaran: The Demon Bottle is a really solid Zelda 1–style dungeon game, with a heavy emphasis on puzzles rather than combat.

Battles are very easy, there’s no real punishment for dying, and combat clearly isn’t the focus. Instead, the game wants you thinking. The puzzles are the core of the experience, and they genuinely make you stop, observe your surroundings, read hints carefully, and piece together solutions. When something finally clicks, it feels great. It’s the kind of puzzle design that rewards patience and attention rather than reflexes.

The sound design is wonderful and does a great job supporting the atmosphere, and the controls work exactly how you’d expect. Being able to move diagonally helps a lot and makes navigation feel smooth and natural.

My main issue is the complete lack of settings. You can’t adjust the volume, you can’t rebind controls, and if there is a windowed mode, I couldn’t find it. It’s a noticeable limitation, even for a small game.

That said, for a $2 game, this was sick. I highly, highly recommend it. It’s the kind of game where you can look at it and immediately know whether it’s for you or not, and if it is, it delivers exactly what you’re hoping for.
