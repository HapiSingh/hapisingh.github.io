Logged in for a bit today, and took some pictures and hung out with ルリ!

She was super lovely and I had a good time with her won’t lie. We then moved on to fight Delmeze 3 together, helping some of her friends practice the fight I think, so that was cool. I don’t know if I really helped much, but oh well.

Later on, I talked again in Shion’s room, took a few pics with an AFK Shion, and then gave a hug to Shion.

I do really love hugs. I have to take way more hug pictures eventually. Maybe I’ll dedicate a page on this blog to people I’ve hugged.

<p>
Something to think about, eh?

This morning there was another cool experience, I decided to go and hang out and talk to people in the French DQX Server, wow they were all super friendly. I really enjoyed talking to them, and I honestly would be down to hang out with them again. It might reinvigorate my love for DQX to be honest. There's a person there named 2Nas, and not only does he really love DQX, so he was super awesome to talk to, he also expressed an interest in endgame, has maybe enough money to take on the lighter bosses like Noxeria, and so on, I'm really hopeful to be honest. But even besides that, that community seems super welcoming and friendly, even if I don't speak french, I have tons of experience not knowing a language of a server I'm in, so surely I can adapt again, IT CAN'T BE HARDER THAN JAPANESE RIGHT??
</p>

<p>
Either way, DQX might be making a comeback soon, we'll see...
