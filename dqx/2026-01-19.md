<h1>Hanging Out in Astoltia</h1>

<p>
Logged in for a bit today, and took some pictures and hung out with ルリ!

She was super lovely and I had a good time with her won’t lie. We then moved on to fight Delmeze 3 together, helping some of her friends practice the fight I think, so that was cool. I don’t know if I really helped much, but oh well.

Later on, I talked again in Shion’s room, took a few pics with an AFK Shion, and then gave a hug to Shion.

I do really love hugs. I have to take way more hug pictures eventually. Maybe I’ll dedicate a page on this blog to people I’ve hugged.

<p>
Something to think about, eh?
