## Short Return to DQX

Today I played more DQX then usual, we did ADF for an hour, this time it was white wings, I got A THIRD light 42% resistance shield and was so upset, I threw it out immediately

The entire group was talking about how many languages I speak, I don't think it's anything special, but it felt nice to be noticed, I don't usually feel that way

I got a video recorded of it too with decent gameplay, just good to have more footage of the game on the internet

I also went back to Delmeze, played with Mole and Mahou, we did 1 meal, we didn't win but, it was fun and the banter was light and friendly, helped me feel accepted and not ashamed

I was pretty rusty though, maybe I should get back to the game some more, but there's just so much that make it inconvenient... It'll take some time for sure


I also met a new foreigner player, he seems to be interested in battle contents which was cool, gives me motivation to play the game more. I'd like to feel healthier soon and get back to streaming it so that way there's more endgame english content in the world. Or high level english content

I also took several pictures with some friends, it was awesome, I am glad they were so receptive to it
