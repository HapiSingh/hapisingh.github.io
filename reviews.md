# Reviews

This page is a timeline of reviews I’ve written and shared here as I go.

These are scored reviews, reflecting my personal experience rather than any claim of objectivity.  
I care most about how a game *feels* — movement, pacing, atmosphere, and intent tend to matter more to me than polish alone.

New reviews appear here when I write them.
