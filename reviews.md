# Reviews

This is where I write longer thoughts about games I’ve played.
These are scored reviews, but the score is meant to reflect my personal experience rather than any claim of objectivity.

I care more about how a game *feels* than how it performs on a checklist.
Movement, pacing, atmosphere, and intent matter a lot to me, and those tend to shape both my writing and the final score.

Some reviews are long.
Some are short.
All of them are written honestly, with context and reflection in mind.
